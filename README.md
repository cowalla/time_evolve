### What is this??

This package will time-evolve the Schr√∂dinger equation.

### Using the project
You must have 'pip' and virtualenv to use this lil package
* Clone this Repo
* Navigate to directory and run the following
** `virtualenv .`
** `. bin/activate`
** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* wait for packages to install
** `cd time_evolve`
* Run the script: 'python script.py'

### What the heck just happened?
You just ran a script that evolved a wave, through time, towards a wall. When 
the wave encountered the wall, it rebounded and some of it `tunneled` 
through. WOO!
