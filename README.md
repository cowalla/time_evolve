### What is this??

This package will time-evolve the Schr√∂dinger equation.

### Using the project
You must have 'pip' and virtualenv to use this lil package
* Clone this Repo
* Navigate to directory and run the following
* `virtualenv --python=python3 venv`
* `source venv/bin/activate`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the script: 
```
python time_evolve.py
```

### What the heck just happened?
You just ran a script that evolved a wave, through time, towards a wall. When 
the wave encountered the wall, it rebounded and some of it *tunneled* 
through.
